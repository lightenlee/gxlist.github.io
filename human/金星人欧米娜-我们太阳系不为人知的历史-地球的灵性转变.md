# 我们太阳系不为人知的历史-地球的灵性转变

作者：Omnec Onec（欧米娜•欧涅克）

1994年，我在冥想中开了个会。我发现自己在一个山谷里，周围有成千上万的人，有人类的，也有非人类的，其中当然有我认识的人，如保罗·翠契尔和我的姨父奥丁。这时他们第一次告诉我转变的过程。

自1930年代以来，他们一直在努力，在这里一步一步地创造能量。关于这个问题已经开了很多会议，需要很多生命的合作。有些人不想参加，有些人参加了，有些来自其他星系的生命根本不关心。但他们相信，地球是一个如此特殊的星球，因为它有所有不同的生命形式。

这么多不同的外星人曾经访问过这里，并为这里的生命做出了贡献。

为了理解这种转变和过程是什么，你必须了解这个太阳系的历史，人类和地球的未知历史。这是本次会议上大师们和众生向我展示的信息。

大约4000万年前——并不是精确的时间，因为时间并不重要，只有事件才是重要的，而时间是人类创造的概念——从四个不同的星系，有四个不同的人类种族被送到这个太阳系。他们得到了「灵性阶层」的通知，来到这里并在较早的星球上进行殖民。他们远比你能想象的要先进。他们不仅有能力前往不同的星系，还能进入不同的维度，前往未来或过去。

他们有心灵感应的能力，不需要口头语言，除非是在与进化程度较低的生命交流时需要。他们与所有的生命形式交流，包括动物、植物和矿物。他们还与其他维度上的人交流，这些人以前生活在肉体上，如天使，扬升大师等。

他们的技术与创造的自然法则完全和谐。他们已经掌握了用思想的能量进行创造的概念。这伴随着责任：基于有益和和谐的积极和建设性的动机而使用，还是基于自私的动机而使用，如获得权力和财富。

他们对创造和创造者有完全的了解。他们知道自己是灵魂，是永恒的，不受限于肉体。死亡对他们来说并不存在。对他们来说，这是从一种存在形式到另一种存在形式的过渡。他们根据自己希望拥有的经验或希望完成的任务来选择自己的寿命。

他们来到这个太阳系，把人类的生命带到这里，成为所有星球上所有生命的保护者。黄种人殖民了你们所知的火星，红种人殖民了土星，黑种人殖民了木星，白种人殖民了金星。

当时的地球只是一颗四处飞舞的彗星，因为它还没有形成行星的形态，也没有稳定在围绕太阳的轨道上。当地球最终成为一颗行星时，它是美丽的，有大量的水体。

这四个种族去了遥远的星系，带来了许多形式的动物、鱼类、鸟类、植物和矿物，并创造了一个独特的天堂，所有的生命形式都和谐地生活在那里。

在其他系统内，也有人类和其他非人类生物，他们不像这四个种族那样先进。然而，他们拥有太空旅行的技术，但仍然保留着更具侵略性和征服性的意识水平。他们曾听说过这个美丽的新星球。此时，地球有两颗卫星来协调天气状况，控制大型水体的潮汐。

第一批居住在这个星球上的生物是来自太阳系外两个不同系统的恐龙和爬虫类种族。他们很聪明，像人类一样用两条腿走路，而且喜欢战争，认为自己比其他所有的生命形式都优越。在过去，那时的人类还没有扬弃战争行为，于是人类的四个种族就与他们发生了冲突。他们来到地球，掠夺地球上的矿物和宝贵的宝石。很快，他们制造了一场可怕的战争。来自他们母星的增援部队加入了他们。一个在地球的一个卫星上建立了基地，另一个在地球上。这是一场使用先进的核武器和激光武器的可怕战争，就像你在科幻电影中看到的那样。它持续了很长时间。大多数的生命形式躺在烧焦的废墟中，而那颗卫星被摧毁了。由于对地球不再感兴趣，他们回到了自己的星球，留下了对他们没有用处的伤员。

四个种族派出了一些部队，看看他们是否能帮助受伤的恐龙人和爬虫人，并看看他们能做些什么来修复地球。他们很快发现，由于核辐射，在地球被清除之前，地球上太危险了。甚至他们也不得不留下来，以免污染他们自己的星球。

由于辐射，恐龙和爬行动物的幸存者变异为你们历史上所知道的恐龙和巨型爬行动物。被困在那里的人类则变异成你们所说的尼安德特人。

地球仍然是一个被破坏的废墟，被巨大的黑暗核云所覆盖，剩下的植被被巨型生物吞噬，也有一些是人类和动物。这种情况持续了几百年，直到一颗巨大的彗星撞上了其中一个海洋，形成了另一个巨大的云。这创造了如此黑暗的环境，以至于太阳的辐射热量无法与地球的引力场相互作用，于是就产生了冰河时代。这摧毁了变异的生命形式，使四个种族有机会用技术和他们的能量清洁和治愈地球。

他们再次将各种形式的生命带到地球，再次创造了一个天堂，除了极端的天气条件和极端的潮汐活动。

在这段时间里，他们意识到他们的星球正在进入自然休眠阶段，他们将无法支持物理生命。所以他们决定用自己的人去殖民地球。他们担心那一个月亮，因为它正在为地球的结构制造地震和潮汐、风暴等麻烦。他们知道如何喝水来保护和平衡自己。这些是第一批殖民地，如亚特兰蒂斯和雷姆利亚。

其余的人留在他们的星球上，等待着他们的命运。他们知道，他们会灭亡和死亡。他们决定只把年轻一代与一些精神导师和长者带到地球上。这个星球对他们所有人来说太小了。但他们并不害怕死亡。

他们再一次创造了一个天堂。他们被指示在这里建造特殊的寺庙，作为通往其他维度的大门。在那里他们可以进行冥想，并与更高级的生命交流。因为有侵略性的生物的威胁，这些寺庙被隐藏起来，以备将来有重要的时候使用。

他们被告知要用冰粒在地球周围建立两个防护罩，以平衡一个月亮的影响。他们为地球创造了一个热带气候。那时候还没有沙漠。他们为这些门道准备了特殊的水晶，他们能够降低振动，通过这些门道进入。关于这个美丽星球的消息传开了。于是黑暗势力再次来到这里，他们是人类，但没有当时那么先进。他们有不同的遗传结构。他们非常强大，但想用这种力量来操纵和控制。

被留在其他星球上的人在最后时刻做了冥想，作为奖励，灵界高层告诉他们，他们的文化将存在于其他维度，这将保护这里的生命。这对他们来说是很好的，而且在未来也会有作用。

另一个种族的人类从一个接近的系统来到这里，试图通过谈判获得信息和技术。但当他们被告知不能拥有这些信息和技术，是因为害怕他们滥用和违反精神法律。他们向殖民地宣战。殖民地没有反击，而是把他们的大部分人送进了藏身处，以便日后重建殖民地。他们摧毁了一切，以免落入黑暗势力之手。雷姆利亚和亚特兰蒂斯被其居民摧毁，这样他们的知识和技术就不会被黑暗势力滥用。一些人躲在他们仍然生活着的地球中心。

在这个过程中，水晶结构被破坏了，躲在地球表面的一部分人被告知地球上将会有一场洪水，因为水晶结构会掉落和融化，造成巨大的洪水。所以他们要建造巨大的船只，尽可能多地拯救生命体。有数以百计的方舟，而不是像《圣经》中告诉我们的那样只有一艘。他们等待着洪水的退去，就像黑暗势力一样。他们再次来到这里，捕捉这些人，因为他们已经意识到他们在基因上的不同。他们折磨他们，为他们自己和他们的权力尽可能多地获取关于隐藏的神庙的信息。

因为他们知道，只要人们能与其他维度沟通，他们就能重建地球，所以他们把所有被抓的人的大脑分开，这样他们就不再有能力与其他维度沟通，也不记得他们过去的生活、技术、庙宇或任何东西。人类被重新编程，并被设定为不同的种族和颜色，他们给了人们宗教，把自己设定为被崇拜的神。战争发展了，控制力量是那些富有的人，他们拥有所有的信息和权力。情况越来越糟，今天也不例外。它在一个更微妙的层面上继续，而人类已经不再意识到这一点。虽然他们内心深处有一种感觉，认为有更多的东西，而且他们确实在仰望星空，相信他们来自其他地方，因为他们觉得他们在这里的存在是不正确的。当然是他们的灵魂确实记得这一点，但完整的编程让人们意识不到。

转变是，所有这些从那时起转世并发展起来的生命，以及灵性等级制度本身都想纠正这一点。他们所做的第一件事就是在地球上引入灵性信息。有大量的信息涌来，秘教运动在社会上发展，变得越来越流行和普遍。他们也联系了各国的领导人，但合作被拒绝了，因为他们不打算放弃自己的控制。灵界人士知道他们必须拯救地球，使其不再陷入毁灭，他们知道随着技术的发展，这里会有更多的基因操纵。

此外，原子弹的发明是地球可能被完全摧毁的风险。这将产生巨大的影响，不仅是对这个太阳系，而且对整个银河系，它将伤害无数生命。

因此，银河系兄弟会（由来自不同维度的无数精神上高度进化的生命组成的联合会）决定结束这种控制、操纵和滥用。几十年来，他们正在努力改变这个星球的整个能量，这样一来，既有的技术最终将停止运作，但当转变完成后，当这个星球及其居民的频率改变后，新的技术将被引入。

所有的银河兄弟会、许多人类和非人类的种族、精神层次、扬升大师、非物质的生命，如天使，以及自然界的精灵都在合作。盖亚女士是地球本身的特别天使。

隐藏的寺庙已被重新激活，因此，能量也通过它们从更高的领域流入。太空船位于地球周围，以发送振动来改变频率。这些飞船的振动速度非常快，人眼无法看到，雷达也无法探测到，它们不断向地球发送自己的特殊能量。自然之灵通知所有的自然界改变其频率，鸟儿的声音、蜜蜂、水、风，一切都对我们的环境产生影响。

频率的增加是一个渐进的过程。大约从1993年开始，当隐藏的寺庙被重新激活时，可以肯定的是，这个过程将是成功的。他们以前不知道，但在这么多不同的层面上和这里的人们一起努力。参与越多，转变就越快。他们使之成为一个渐进的转变，因为太快的变化会破坏细胞结构。

你有一个人工支持系统，这是一个新的脉轮系统。它使两半大脑与新的频率同步运作，使他们恢复祖先的能力，拥有心灵感应、直觉、记住前世，并接受个人的精神信息。

脉轮是通往每个维度能量的微型门，身体里的每个维度都有一个脉轮。1993年以后出生的孩子已经有了身体内的变化。他们出生时，遗传系统和新的脉轮系统都是完整的。

在获得新的脉轮系统时，可能会有一些身体上的不舒服的感觉，如短促的疼痛，就像有人在你的身体里扎针一样，你的视力模糊，你的耳朵里有高亢的声音，你会有快速的心跳。你会有感到有点恐慌的时候，你会感到可怕的疲倦，即使你已经休息了很多。有时你只睡了几个小时就会醒来，你会感到非常有活力。食欲会有波动，你会有不断感到饥饿的时候，也会有根本不觉得需要吃东西的时候。所有这些异常情况都是暂时的。重要的是要多喝水，把某些毒素冲出体外。

你的直觉能力正在恢复，你通过精神心灵感应相互沟通的能力也在恢复。

我们必须认识到，一切都很有价值。即使是负面的力量，也是为了帮助我们体验自己的多样化品质，或者体验这些品质和可能性。但有些人变得喜欢拥有权力和控制权，并利用生命能量来控制他人。一直以来，人们无法克服自我，无法克服为了『小我』和自私而利用对方和这种能量的倾向。

在未来，地球将起到与过去不同的作用。它或多或少是一个人们可以遇到来自灵魂的相反能量（即阴和阳，消极和积极）的地方。当然，在现实中它是同一种能量。这种划分是由概念定义造成的。通过确定这种行为是坏的，不同的态度是好的，你把能量分为好的和坏的。这样一来，你也帮助支持了负面过程。

我们的祖先是完全无私的人。他们不想破坏或损害任何来自造物主、来自大自然的东西，因为他们觉得与大自然和谐相处。这是一种自然的生存方式，与这个物质世界中现有的生命形式相应、沟通、并与它们合作。这些都是将被重新安装在人类身上的东西。

在过去，在地球上的原始殖民地期间，女性的特质占主导地位。人们更多地使用他们的直觉和爱与关怀的女性原则。然后，在基因操纵之后，男性能量以更多的力量、更多的破坏、更多的力量来控制社会和个人。在未来，地球将成为一个两性力量在人体内平等和平衡的地方。

此外，地球将让人类可以在一个生命周期中体验一切，让人们可以表现出一个选择的身体。它不一定是男性或女性，它可以是两种能量和品质合二为一，因为肉体将不像现在这样由相同的材料构成，它将处于不同的频率。

人们将形成社区和联系，与动物和不同的生命形式一起工作。地球将是一个与你所知完全不同的地方。

随着负面力量的崩溃，侵略性将消退，将不需要实际压制他人或负责某事。每个人都将负责自己的自我和创造自己的存在。恐惧将被消除，我们将不再需要人造的法律，我们将自然而然地服从精神法则，因为作为一个具有完整意识和觉知的高级灵魂，你将能够以一种与存在的一切和谐的方式来管理自己。我们在其他星球上已经以这种方式生活了数百万年。这只是一种服从精神法则的自然和谐。

要单独经历这个过程，接受我们社会中发生的变化，需要很大的意志力和接受力。你只需要帮助想象和创造这些可能性。想象一下它可以是什么样子，或者你喜欢它是什么样子，最终你会拥有这些。我们可以期待实际创造我们是什么，我们希望是什么，我们希望体验什么，而不是被迫体验已经存在的东西。

我希望这些信息能够激励你，给你勇气和能力去面对即将到来的任何事情，并接受它作为神圣的意愿，因为在生命的连续过程中，无论发生什么，总是注定要发生的。你必须学会接受事物，依靠你的创造能力来度过困难时期。但你有来自其他生命的援助，他们有一种替代的力量和能量方法供你使用。

在地球遥远的未来，在转变完成后，将是一个完全不同的生活方式和地球上完全不同的意识。

我希望你们能记住的是。一个灵魂是完美的，是美丽的、独立的和完整的。你必须记住你自己的美和品质，你在你的创造中、在你的生命周期中的每一个经历，都是构成每个个体灵魂这个特殊珠宝的一部分。这种美和这些品质是由你的个人过程和通过你的生命经历发展决定的。你的存在是没有尽头的。当你能克服时间和衰老的概念时，你就有了永恒的期待。如果你能快乐，真正欣赏生命和经验的珍贵，那么你就有更好的机会享受美丽的生活和享受。当然，你应该享受你在物质世界中的每一种感觉，因为这些感觉在未来将不一样，因为肉体将完全不同。你必须享受作为一个人的不同方面，当然也要在自己内心创造一种平衡与和谐，因为只有你才能做到这一点。

我希望这些信息是有价值的，并希望你能与他人分享，因为越多的人有意识地积极参与转变过程，并开始以积极的方式使用他们的能量，转变就会越快。

我想留给你一句金星的问候语，意思是 "愿宇宙的爱和祝福"：AMUAL ABAKTU BARAKA BASHAD.。

### The Unknown History of our Solar System

### The Spiritual Transformation of the Earth

In 1994, I had a meeting in meditation. I found myself in a valley, surrounded by thousands of people, human and non-human, among them people that I recognized like Paul Twitchell and Uncle Odin, of course. This is when they told me of the transformation process for the first time.

Since the 1930ies they had been working on it, creating the energy here step by step. There had been many meetings about it and needed the cooperation of many beings. Some did not want to participate, some did, and some beings from other galaxies just did not care. But they were convinced that the Earth is such a special planet because of all the different life forms that are on it.

So many different aliens had visited and contributed to the life here.

In order to understand the transformation and what the process is, you have to understand the history of this solar system, the human beings and the unknown history of the Earth. This was the information that was shown to me by the Masters and beings at this meeting:

About 40 million years ago this is not precise because time is of no consequence, only the events are important and time is a concept created by man – from four different galaxies there were sent four different races of humans to this solar system. They were informed by the Spiritual Hierarchy to travel here and colonize the older planets. They were far more advanced that you can imagine. Not only did they have the ability to travel to different galaxies but also into different dimensions and to the future or the past.

They had telepathic abilities and no need of spoken language unless necessary for communicating with less evolved beings. They communicated with all life forms, animal, plant and mineral. They also communicated with those on other dimensions, who previously lived in the physical, angels, ascended masters, etc.

Their technology was in complete harmony with the natural laws of creation. They had mastered the concepts of creativity with the energy of their thoughts. This comes with the responsibility to use it for positive and constructive reasons that are beneficial and harmonic or for selfish reasons, such as gaining power and wealth.

They had complete understanding of creation and the creator. They knew themselves to be Soul and eternal, not restricted to the physical body. Death to them did not exist. For them it was a transition from one existence to another. They chose their own life spans according to the experiences they wished to have or missions they wished to complete.

They came to this solar system to bring human life here and to be the protectors of all life on all planets. The yellow race colonized the planet you know as Mars, the red race the planet Saturn, the black race Jupiter and the white race Venus.

Earth was then only a comet flying around as it had not taken the form of a planet or settled into an orbit around the sun. When the Earth finally became a planet, it was beautiful with large bodies of water.

The four races went to far galaxies and brought many forms of animals, fish, birds, plants and minerals and created a unique paradise where all life forms lived in harmony.

Within other systems there were also humans and other non-human beings that were not as advanced as these four races. However, they had the technology for space travel but still retained a more aggressive and conquering level of consciousness. They had heard of this beautiful new planet. At this time, Earth had two moons to harmonize the weather conditions and control the tides of the large bodies of water.

The first beings to inhabit the planet were a dinoid and reptoid race from two different systems outside our solar system. They were intelligent and walked on two legs like humans and were war-like considering themselves to be superior to all other life forms. In the past, the four races of humans had conflicts with them before they outgrew such behavior. They arrived on Earth to rob it of its minerals and valuable gems. Soon they had created a terrible war. They were joined by re-enforcements from their home planets. One set up its base on one of the Earth's moons, the other on Earth. It was a terrible war with advanced nuclear and laser weapons like you see in your science fiction movies. It lasted very long. Most of the life forms lay in singed waste and the one moon was destroyed. No longer interested in Earth, they went back to their planets leaving their wounded behind, they had no use for them.

The four races sent a few forces to see if they could help the wounded dinoids and reptilians and to see what they could do to repair the Earth. They soon found that due to the nuclear radiation it was too dangerous on Earth before it was cleared. Even they had to remain so as not to contaminate their own planets.

Due to the radiation, the survivors of the dinoids and reptoids mutated into the Dinosaurs and giant reptilians you know of in your history. The humans that were trapped there mutated into what you call Neanderthals.

The Earth remained a devastated ruin, covered by a huge dark nuclear cloud and what vegetation was left was being devoured by the giant beings, also humans and animals by some. It was this way for hundreds of years before a giant comet crashed into one of the oceans and created another huge cloud. This created such darkness that the radiating heat of the sun could not interact with Earth's gravitational field and an ice age was created. This destroyed the mutated life forms and gave the four races the chance to cleanse and heal the Earth with technology and their energy.

Once again, they brought various forms of life to the Earth, creating again a paradise, except for extreme weather conditions and extreme tidal activities.

During this time they realized that their planets were going into a natural dormant stage that they would not be able to support physical life. So they decided to colonize the Earth with their own people. They were concerned about the one moon, because it is creating earth quakes and tidal waves and storms and other difficulties for the structure of the Earth. They knew how to drink fluids to protect and balance themselves. These were the first colonies like Atlantis and Lemuria.

The rest of the people stayed on their planets to await their destiny. They knew that they would perish and die. They had made the decision only to bring the younger generation with some spiritual teachers and elders to the earth. The planet was too small for all of them. But they had no fear of death.

They had once again created a paradise. They were instructed to build special temples here as doorways to the other dimensions. There they could do their meditations and communicate with the higher beings. Because of the aggressive beings, the temples were hidden for future times when they will be important.

They were informed to build two shields around the Earth out of ice particles to balance the influence of the one moon. They created a tropical climate for the Earth. There were no deserts at that time. They have special crystals for these doorways and they were able to lower their vibration to enter through these doorways. The news spread of the beautiful planet. So the dark forces came here again, they are human beings but not as advanced at that time. They have a different genetic structure. They were very powerful but wanted to use this power for manipulating and controlling.

The people that were left on the other planets were doing a meditation at their last moment and as a reward the Spiritual Hierarchy told them that their culture would exist in the other dimensions and that this would protect the beings here. It was wonderful for them and it would serve a purpose in the future.

Another race of humans from a close system came here and tried to negotiate to get information and technology, but when they were informed that they could not have it for fear of misuse and break of the spiritual laws. They declared war on the colonies. The colonies did not fight back but send most of their people into hiding to rebuild the colonies later. They destroyed everything so that it would not fall into the hands of the dark forces. Lemuria and Atlantis were destroyed by their inhabitants so that their knowledge and technology would not be misused by the dark forces. Some people hid in the center of the earth, were they are still living.

In this process the crystal structures were damaged, and part of the people that were hiding on the surface of the Earth were informed that there would be a flood on the earth, because the crystal structures were going to fall and melt and cause a huge flood. So they were to build huge ships and save as many life forms as they could. There were hundreds of arks, not just one like we are told in the bible. They waited for the flood to recede, as did the dark forces. They came here once again to capture these people because they had realized that they were genetically different. They tortured them to get as much information as they could about the hidden temples for themselves and their power.

As they knew that the people could rebuild the Earth as long as they had their communication with the other dimensions, they separated the brain halves of all the beings they captured, so that they would no longer have the ability to communicate with the other dimensions or remember their past lives or the technology or the temples or anything. The human beings were reprogrammed and set up as different races and colors and they gave them religions and set themselves up as gods to be worshipped. Wars developed and the controlling forces were the rich ones, having all the information and power. It got worse and worse and today it is not different. It is continuing on a more subtle level, and the human beings have no longer an awareness of this. Although deep inside they have a feeling that there is more and they do look to the heavens and believe that they came from somewhere else, because they feel their existence here is not correct. Of course it is their soul that does remember this, but the programming here is so complete.

The transformation is that all of these beings that have reincarnated since then and developed as well as the Spiritual Hierarchy themselves want to correct this. The first thing they did was to introduce the spiritual information here on Earth. There was an influx of information coming, and the esoteric movement grew in the societies and became more and more popular and common. They also contacted the leaders of the countries, but the cooperation was refused as they were not going to give up their control. The spiritual beings knew that they must save the Earth from going into destruction again and they knew that with the technology developed there would be more genetic manipulation here.

Furthermore, the invention of the atomic bomb was the risk that the Earth could be totally destroyed. This would have vast effects, not only for this solar system, but for the whole galaxy, and it would damage innumerous beings.

The Galactic Brotherhood (a federation of innumerous spiritually high evolved beings from different dimensions) therefore decided to put an end to this control, manipulation, and misuse. For decades, they are working to change the whole energy of this planet so that the established technologies eventually would cease to function, but new technologies will be introduced when the transformation is complete and when the frequency of the planet and its inhabitants has changed.

All of the Galactic Brotherhood, many races human and non-human the Spiritual Hierarchy, Ascended Masters, non-physical beings like angels, and the nature spirits are cooperating. Lady Gaia is the special angel for the Earth itself.

The hidden temples have been reactivated, so that also energy flows in from the higher realms through them. Space ships were located around the Earth to send vibrations to change the frequency. These ships vibrate at such a rate that they cannot be seen by human eyes or detected by radar, and they are continually sending their special energy to the Earth. The nature spirits informed all of nature to change its frequency the birds sound, the bees, the water, the wind everything has an effect on our environment.

The increase of the frequency is a gradual process. Approximately since 1993, when the hidden temples had been reactivated, it is certain that the process will be successful. They did not know it before, but the effort was made on so many different levels and with the people here. The more participation the faster the transformation will take place. They made it a gradual transformation, because the too fast changes would have damaged the cellular structure.

You have an artificial support system which is a new chakra system. It synchronizes the two brain halves to function as one along with the new frequencies, to give them back the abilities of their ancestors, to have mental telepathy, intuition, remember past lives, and receive individual spiritual information.

Chakras are miniature doorways to the energy of each dimension there is a chakra for each dimension in the body. Children born after 1993 already have the changes within their bodies. They are born with the genetic system and the new chakra system intact.

While getting the new chakra system, there can be some physical uncomfortable feelings, such as short sharp pains like someone is sticking a needle in your body, you have your vision blurring, you have high-pitched sounds in your ears, you will have rapid heartbeats. You will have times when your feel a little panicky, you will feel dreadfully tired even if you have rested plenty. Sometimes you will wake up after only a few hours sleeping and you will feel very energetic. Appetite will fluctuate, you will have times when you are constantly hungry and times when you don't feel the need to eat at all. All these unusual occurrences are temporary. It is important to drink plenty of liquids, to flush certain toxins out of the body.

Your intuitive abilities are returning, and your ability to communicate through mental telepathy with one another.

We have to realize that everything is valuable. Even the negative forces served to help us to experience diverse qualities of ourselves or to experience these qualities and possibilities. But some people become attached to having the power and the control and to use the life energy for control over others. It has been the problem that the people cannot overcome their ego and their tendencies to use each other and this energy for their own general self and selfishness.

In the future, the Earth will serve a different purpose than it has served in the past. It was more or less a place where that people could encounter the opposite energy from the soul the yin and yang, the negative and the positive. Of course, in reality it is the same energy. The division has been created by concepts. By determining that this behavior is bad and a different attitude is good, you divide the energy into good and bad. This way, you also help support the negative process.

Our ancestors were totally selfless people. They did not want to destroy or damage anything that was from the creator, from nature, because they felt in a harmony with it. It was a natural way of surviving with the existing life forms in this physical world corresponding, communicating,  and cooperating with them. These are the things that are going to be reinstalled in the human being.

In the past, during the original colonies on Earth, the feminine qualities were ruling. The people were more using their intuition and the feminine principles of loving and caring. Then, after the genetic manipulation, the male energy was controlling the societies and individuals with more force, more destruction, more might. In the future, the Earth will serve as a place, where that the male and the female powers will be equal and balanced within every individual.

Furthermore, the Earth will serve as a purpose for human beings to experience everything in one life cycle. They can manifest a body of choice. It does not have to be male or female, it can be the both energies and the qualities in one, because the physical body will not be of the same material as it is now and it will be on a different frequency.

People will form communities and connections and work together with the animals and the different life forms. The Earth will be a totally different place than you know.

With the collapse of the negative powers, the aggression will recede, and there will be no need to actually overpower others or to be in charge of something. Every person will be in charge of their own selves and of creating their existence. The fear will be removed, and we will not have the need of the manmade laws anymore, we will just naturally obey the spiritual laws, because as an advanced soul with a full consciousness and awareness, you will be able to govern yourself in a way that is in harmony with everything that exists. We have lived that way on other planets for millions of years. It is just a natural harmony of obeying the spiritual laws.

It takes a lot of willpower and acceptance to go through this process individually and accepting the changes that take place in our societies. You only have to help to visualize and to create these possibilities. Imagine what it can be like or what you like it to be like, and eventually you will have that. We can look forward to actually creating what we are, what we wish to be, what we wish to experience rather than being forced to experience what already exists.

I hope that this information can inspire you and gives you the courage and ability to face whatever will come and accept it as the divine will, because whatever happens in the continuum of life is always meant to be. You have to learn to accept things and depend on your creative abilities to see you through the difficult times. But you have assistance from the other beings who have an alternative method of power and energy for you to use.

In the very very future of the Earth, after the transformation is complete, it will be a totally different living style and a totally different awareness on the Earth.

The thing that I hope that you can remember is: A soul is perfect, a soul is beautiful, and individual and complete. You have to remember your own beauty and qualities, that every experience that you have ever had in your creation, in your life cycles, is a part of what makes up the special jewel that is each individual soul. This beauty and these qualities are determined by your individual process and development through your life experiences. There is no end to your existence. You have eternity to look forward to, when you can overcome the concepts of time and aging. If you can be happy and really appreciate the preciousness of life and experiences, then you have a better chance for a beautiful life and enjoying. Of course, you should enjoy every sense that you have in the physical world, because these senses will not be the same in the future, as the physical body will be totally different. You have to enjoy the different aspects of being a human being, and of course creating a balance and a harmony within yourself, because you are the only one that can do that.

I hope this information is valuable and that you can share it with others, because the more people consciously and actively participate in the transformation process and start using their energy in a positive way, the faster it will go.

I would like to leave you with a Venusian greeting which means "May the Universal love and blessings be": AMUAL ABAKTU BARAKA BASHAD.
